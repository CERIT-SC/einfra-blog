tease: "CESNET introduces TESP-API — a lightweight microservice implementing the GA4GH Task Execution Service (TES) standard, bridging scientific platforms with distributed compute resources."
---

The ability to submit and manage computing tasks across different environments is essential for modern e-infrastructure. The **GA4GH Task Execution Service (TES)** defines a standard interface for doing exactly this, ensuring that diverse workflow systems can interoperate with shared computational backends.

To bring this standard into real use, **CESNET** has developed **TESP-API** — a standalone microservice that translates TES requests into executable tasks for **Pulsar**, a distributed job execution system widely used in the Galaxy Project ecosystem.  
The source code is available at [github.com/CESNET/tesp-api](https://github.com/CESNET/tesp-api).

## How TESP Works

TESP-API implements the GA4GH TES specification and acts as a bridge between TES clients and computational backends.  
When a task is submitted, TESP generates the corresponding **Pulsar execution commands**, manages job staging, and delegates file transfers directly to the compute node.  
This **direct storage–worker–storage** approach avoids unnecessary data hops, improving performance and reliability.  
TESP currently supports **HTTP, FTP, and S3** transfer protocols.

## Deployment and Use

TESP can be deployed via Docker Compose in two configurations:
- **Self-contained mode** – runs both TESP and a Pulsar instance, suitable for testing or local development.  
- **Standalone mode** – connects to an existing Pulsar service, ideal for integration into production systems.

At **usegalaxy.cz**, the national Galaxy instance operated by **CESNET**, TESP-API is already used for selected workloads under production-like conditions.  
This demonstrates its ability to integrate distributed data storage, computing nodes, and user-facing platforms in a unified, standards-based workflow.

## Outlook

TESP-API shows how open standards such as GA4GH TES can be turned into **practical, deployable services** within national and international research e-infrastructures.  
By connecting high-level scientific environments like Galaxy to underlying compute and storage resources, TESP helps move toward **fully interoperable, production-ready distributed computing**.

**TESP-API** is an evolving component of CESNET’s infrastructure toolkit — bridging research workflows, compute resources, and data services through open, standardized interfaces.
